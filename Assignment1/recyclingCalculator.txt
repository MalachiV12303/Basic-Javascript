Prompt:
Employees at Morning Buzz Coffee Shop have been told they’ll get a bonus if they
bring in enough pounds of recyclable newspapers. They want a program to calculate
the amount they need to bring in each day to make this total, based on the total number
of pounds to be collected and the number of days they’ll be bringing in newspapers. The
program should ask for these amounts and calculate how many pounds they need to
bring in each day to make the total in that number of days. They plan to run the program
several times until they find a number of pounds that seems reasonable.


Algorithm:
Initialize poundsRequired to total number of pounds needed to collect
Initialize days to total days they have to collect these papers

Set perDay to poundsRequired divided by days
Print "It would take a rate of (perDay) pounds per day to achieve (poundsRequired) pounds in (days) days"
