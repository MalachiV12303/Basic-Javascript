Prompt:
Justin Kace is promoting the metric system and wants people to be able to convert
miles to kilometers and kilometers to miles. You are to develop a program that asks the
user for a number of miles and converts miles to kilometers (multiplying miles by 1.609),
and then asks for a number of kilometers and converts kilometers to miles (multiplying
kilometers by 0.6214).


Algorithm:
Initialize milesIn to user input
Initialize kiloOut to milesIn times 1.609
Prints "Kilometers is (kiloOut)"

Initialize kiloIn to user input
Initialize milesOut to kiloIn times 0.6214
Prints "Miles is (milesOut)"
