Prompt:
Zach Stern, a floor tiler doing business as Zach Stern’s Tile, needs to know the area
of any rectangular floor he’s tiling. He wants a program that asks for the room’s length
and width and the cost per square foot of tile. The program should calculate and display
the room’s area in square feet and the cost of the tile needed to cover the room.


Algorithm:
Initialize length to 0
Initialize width to 0
Initilize costPerSquareFt to 0

Set length to user input
Set width to user input
Set costPerSquareFt to user input

Initialize area to length times width

Print "Total area is (area)"
Print "Total cost is (costPerSquareFt times area)"
