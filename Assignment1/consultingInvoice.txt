Prompt:
Brianna Watt, a consultant doing business as Watt Gives, wants a program to create
an invoice for consulting services. Normally, she works on a project for five days before
sending an invoice. She writes down the number of hours worked on each day and
needs a program that asks for these amounts, totals them, and multiplies the amount by
her standard rate of $30.00 per hour. The invoice should include Brianna’s business
name, the client’s business name, the total number of hours worked, the rate, and the
total amount billed. The information will be displayed onscreen.


Algorithm:
Initialize constant BUSINESS_NAME to "Watt Gives"
Initialize constant FLAT_RATE to 30.00
Initialize totalAmountBilled to 0
Initialize hoursWorked to 0
Initialize hours to 0

Initialize daysWorked from user input
Initialize clientBusinessName from user input

For the amount of daysWorked
	Set hours to user input
	hoursWorked is set to hoursWorked plus hours

Set totalAmountBilled to hoursWorked multiplied by FLAT_RATE

Print BUSINESS_NAME
Print clientBusinessName
Print hoursWorked
Print FLAT_RATE
Print totalAmountBilled
